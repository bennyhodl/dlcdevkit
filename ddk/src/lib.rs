/// Transport layer for DLC message communication.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for sending and receiving DLC protocol messages
/// between peers. Implementations of this trait (found in the transport module) handle
/// the actual communication layer, such as:
/// - Lightning Network transport
/// - Nostr protocol messaging
/// - Direct TCP/IP connections
/// - In-memory transport (for testing)
///
/// # Implementation Requirements
/// - Must be Send + Sync for thread safety
/// - Must handle connection management
/// - Must support message serialization/deserialization
/// - Must maintain peer connections
///
/// # Usage
/// Implementations are used by the DLC manager to:
/// 1. Establish connections with counterparties
/// 2. Send protocol messages (offers, accepts, signs, etc.)
/// 3. Receive and process incoming messages
/// 4. Maintain connection state

    /// - Incoming message processing
    /// - Connection management
    /// - Message routing to the DLC manager
    /// - Graceful shutdown via stop signal

/// Storage interface for DLC contracts and wallet data.
///
/// This trait extends the Rust-DLC storage trait (`ddk_manager::Storage`) with
/// additional functionality for BDK wallet integration. Implementations must be
/// thread-safe and handle interior mutability due to BDK's requirements.
///
/// # Implementation Notes
/// - Must be wrapped in synchronization primitives (Arc, Mutex, etc.)
/// - Must handle concurrent access to wallet data
/// - Should implement efficient caching where appropriate
/// - Must maintain consistency between DLC and wallet states
///
/// # Common Implementations
/// - PostgreSQL storage (persistent)
/// - Sled storage (persistent, embedded)
/// - In-memory storage (temporary, testing)
